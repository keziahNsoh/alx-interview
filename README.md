# Pascal's Triangle

This project implements a function to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## Description

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top.

## Function

### `pascal_triangle(n)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - `n` (int): The number of rows in Pascal's Triangle to generate.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - A list of lists of integers representing Pascal's Triangle.
  - Returns an empty list if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
