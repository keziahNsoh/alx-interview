# Lockboxes

This project implements a function to determine if all locked boxes can be opened given a specific set of keys contained within each box.

## Description

I have `n` locked boxes, each containing keys to other boxes. The goal is to check if all boxes can be opened, starting from the first box, which is initially unlocked.
